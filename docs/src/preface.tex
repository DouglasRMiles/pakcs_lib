\section*{Preface}

This document describes \CYS (formerly called ``PACS''),
an implementation of the multi-paradigm language Curry,
jointly developed at the University of Kiel, the Technical University
of Aachen and Portland State University.
Curry is a universal programming language aiming at the amalgamation
of the most important declarative programming paradigms,
namely functional programming and logic programming.  
Curry combines in a seamless way features from functional programming
(nested expressions, lazy evaluation, higher-order functions),
logic programming (logical variables, partial data structures,
built-in search), and concurrent programming (concurrent evaluation
of constraints with synchronization on logical variables).
Moreover, the \CYS implementation of Curry also supports
the high-level implementation of distributed applications,
graphical user interfaces, and web services
(as described in more detail in \cite{Hanus99PPDP,Hanus00PADL,Hanus01PADL}).

We assume familiarity with the ideas and features
of Curry as described in the Curry language definition \cite{Hanus12Curry}.
Therefore, this document only explains the use of the different
components of \CYS
and the differences and restrictions of \CYS
(see Section~\ref{sec-restrictions})
compared with the language Curry (Version 0.8.3).

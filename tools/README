PAKCS Tools
===========

This directory contains various tools and (deprecated) libraries
which are currently only available for the PAKCS system.

Currently it contains:

Peval:
   Directory containing a partial evaluator
   (integrated in PAKCS by the command ":peval").
   See the README there for more details.

emacs:
   Emacs mode for editing Curry programs

lib_deprecated:
   This directory contains some deprecated and, thus, unsupported libraries
   for PAKCS, and some older versions of existing libraries where the
   interface has been changed.

optimize:
   Directory containing a simple optimizer for FlatCurry programs
   (integrated in PAKCS by the option "compact").

   for PAKCS, and some older versions of existing libraries where the
   interface has been changed.

   Directory containing a simple optimizer for FlatCurry programs
   (integrated in the Curry2Prolog compiler environment by the
   option "compact").

ui:
   This directory contains libraries to implement generic user interfaces.
